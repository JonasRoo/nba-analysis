# Last step
    - implemented share of team points, quadratic weighting function of points
    - weighting function for individual player performance

# Next steps
    - tweak weighting function (also incorporate new weighted points / share of team points) | remove regular points
    - maybe regression: [numeric attributes] -> team won
