# Last step
    - implemented share of team points, quadratic weighting function of points
    - weighting function for individual player performance

# Next steps
    - tweak weighting function (also incorporate new weighted points / share of team points) | remove regular points
    - maybe regression: [numeric attributes] -> team won


# Last step
    - weighted performance metric by overall points in the game
    - cross-evaluation between Butler and Nunn (Butler "performs better" than Nunn in 88% of all games)

# Next steps
    - refactoring needed URGENTLY
    - pipeline for json response > df with feature engineered columns
    - apply to entire 2018 / 2019 season
    - sum this by team, per game
    - some sort of consistent visualization
